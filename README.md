<h2>Context</h2>

<p>Project was conducted as part of the <b>Computer Vision</b> lecture with the code <b>02010012</b>, which is a course offered by the Computer Engineering faculty. Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world around us. It involves the use of various techniques, including image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning, to analyze and interpret digital images and videos. This project specifically focused on the use of <i>deep learning</i>, which is a subfield of <i>machine learning</i> that involves the use of <i>neural networks</i> to model complex relationships between input and output data. <i>The VGG-16</i> model is a <i>deep neural network architecture</i> that has proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks, as demonstrated by its success in the <i>ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge</i>.</p>

<br>  

<p>By applying this knowledge and utilizing the <i>VGG-16</i> model, you were able to develop a high-performing image <i>classification</i> model for cats and dogs. This project showcases the practical application of computer vision and deep learning techniques in solving real-world problems, and highlights the importance of these techniques in the field of computer engineering.</p>

  

<br>  

<p>The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model using the VGG16 architecture to classify images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. The model will be trained on a dataset of labeled images and evaluated. The ultimate goal is to create a model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs in real-world scenarios.</p>  

<br>

<p>The dataset consists of <i>1,425</i> digital images of domestic animals, specifically <i>713</i> images of dogs and <i>712</i> images of cats. These images were collected for the purpose of training a deep learning model to classify images of cats and dogs with high accuracy. All images were obtained from various online sources and manually labeled by experts to ensure accuracy of the dataset. The images vary in size and resolution, and were preprocessed to remove any artifacts or unwanted information.</p>
